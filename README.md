# Contact Form
One of my personal projects for my Front-End Development

## How I created it!
- The tools that i used here are vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- I customized the contact form instead of using the 'requred' attribute, i used JavaScript instead! ðŸ˜Ž


I'm currently still learning on JavaScript fully but I've missed the poprtunity to use PHP but I will creat another repo for that in the future!

In the meantime this is my contact form with the idea given by Frontend Mentor!
